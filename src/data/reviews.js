I've never had any issues with any of the aesthetician there - they are all good at what they do. But my favorite therapist there is Sonya, she's helped me with my back pain and overall wellbeing for many years.",

There's plenty of parking and I've always found their service to be top notch. They are very accommodating when it comes to scheduling appointments, even if I have last minute requests. It is clear that they are very committed to customer service and we'll see me there for years!",

    text: "Can't believe I'm saying this because I grew up in the Midwest and everyone knows these kinds of places are sketchy, but this is the best spa ever. They're always reliable, never mess up my appointments, and the masseuses are so friendly and helpful. Highly recommend!",

She takes the time to get to know my skin type and do an analysis before giving me a facial specifically tailored to my needs. I am absolutely in love with Blossom Spa.",

The ambiance is so relaxing and serene, I always feel like a new person when I leave. The staff is incredibly welcoming and I've never had a bad experience here. Blossom Spa is hands down my favorite spa in the city, if not the world!",
